# Hey there üçú

This website is a digital garden heavily inspired *(grasp copied)* by [Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com/) and a friend [Vitor Paladini](https://github.com/vtrpldn), who introduced me to the concept. It's a place where things grow, mistakes are made and knowledge is shared like in "Learn in public". Everyone in the open-source community and Twitter has been kind to me and helped me for far, so if you want to talk with me for any reason feel free to schedule [some time with me](https://calendly.com/gabrielreisnf/30min)
